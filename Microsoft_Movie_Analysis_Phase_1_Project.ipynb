    "From my analysis, the following were the greatest determiners of a movie's success:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Genre: Different genres appeal to different audiences and certain genres tend to perform better at the box office than others. Genres such as action, adventure, fantasy, and superhero movies tend to have a wider appeal and thus generate more box office revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Release Timing: The time of year a movie is released directly impacts its box office performance. Movies released during peak seasons or strategically timed to coincide with holidays or special events tend to perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Budget: The effectiveness of a movie's production, marketing and promotional campaigns significantly influence its box office success. A larger budget enables the best production methods and teams and wider promotion tours for a movie leading to higher ticket sales.\n",
